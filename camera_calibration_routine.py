''' 
Routine for calibrating the robot-mounted camera (intrinsics).
This should be performed ideally every time the system is booted up, but at least after any relevant camera or lens parameters have been changed.

Place an AprilTag calibration pattern down in the robot's workspace, and make sure the camera can see it from all angles.
This routine will move the robot through a pre-defined routine and record either a rapid series full-resolution images or the HDMI video feed along the way.
It is not advised to do both at the same time but you can run the routine twice if you need both types of data.

Before running, make sure the camera and robot are both connected, powered on, and ready to receive commands.
If using the HDMI feed, the camera should be connected using both the USB and HDMI port.
The robot should be in a safe resting position at the beginning. Please check that the movement routine is safe before running.

    '''
    Move the robot, capture full-res still images OR 1080p HDMI video for camera calibration.
    Robot/wrist/camera poses are not recorded for this.
    Input parameters:
    capture_params: list of camera capture parameters, these are by default set to minimise Bokeh effects (small aperture) and to facilitate better focus on the calibration pattern.
    use_hdmi_stream: if True, the HDMI video stream is recorded, If False, a burst of full-resolution still images is captured.
    burst: if True, a burst of full-resolution still images is captured continuously during the movement sequence, if False single stills are captured when each defined state in the sequence is reached.
    sleep_time: the time in seconds to wait after each robot movement before capturing an image, to allow the arm to settle.
    hdmi_device: the device name of the HDMI capture device, by default this is set to /dev/video2 (not needed if use_hdmi_stream is False)
    output_directory: the directory where the images or video will be saved. A sub-directory will be created at the location for each run.
    Returns the directory where the images or video are saved.
