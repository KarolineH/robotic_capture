''' 
This module provides a class SyncRecorder that allows to record videos with multiple cameras in synchronisation.
The class provides the following methods:
- start_all(): Start recording a video without fixed duration with all connected cameras in synchronisation.
- stop_all(): Stop recording video for all connected cameras in synchronisation.
- rec_all_for_duration(duration): Record a video of a given duration with all connected cameras in synchronisation.

Note: communication with the cameras has some inherent delays. When using the start and stop methods, 
the actual duration of the recorded video can be slightly longer than the waiting time between function calls (~within 2 seconds).

Note: A common print-out "No matching processes belonging to you were found" can be safely ignored.

Note: Make sure to set all your desired capture parameters in the Camera menu directly, as this script is only intended for synchronisation.

    ### USAGE EXAMPLES
    rec = SyncRecorder()

    # record, wait, stop
    rec.start_all()
    time.sleep(6)
    rec.stop_all()

    # record for a fixed duration
    rec.rec_all_for_duration(5)
