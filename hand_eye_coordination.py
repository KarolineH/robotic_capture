''' 
Routine for calibrating the hand-eye coordination between robot arm and mounted DSLR camera.
This should only need to be performed once, and again whenever the camera is moved or the dimensions of the camera, mount, or lens change.

This routine will record move the robot through 10 target states and record both the wrist poses and a full-resolution image in each state.
In parallel, you can optionally record a 1080p video feed from the camera throughout the whole movement. 

Before running, make sure the camera and robot are both connected, powered on, and ready to receive commands.
The camera should be connected using both the USB and HDMI port.
The robot should be in a safe resting position at the beginning. Please check that the movement routine is safe before running.
